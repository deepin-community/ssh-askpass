ssh-askpass (1:1.2.4.1-13) unstable; urgency=medium

  * the brief switch to source format 1.0 in versions -11 & -12 was an
    prompted by a misconfiguration that was preventing local builds
    working properly.

    Having discovered that, I decided to revert to the old setup while
    keeping the changes I wanted.

    This has at least had the positive side-effect of introducing git
    history for all previous debian releases (since I needed a
    strategy=ours merge to get back on track).
